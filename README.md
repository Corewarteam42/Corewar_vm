THE GAME
The Corewar is an arena (a virtual machine ) where many processes called 
champions (a maximum of 4 champions) fight. A champion is a list of instructions
written in a look-alike disassembly language. The goal of each champion is to 
be the last process alive, i.e the last one to write on the memory. 
when all processes are dead the game ends.

USAGE
./server <port>
./client <address> <port>

1- Send a champion
